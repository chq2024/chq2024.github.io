I am an Associate Professor (without tenure) at the School of Management and Engineering, Nanjing University. I received Ph.D. from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. During my Ph.D. studies, I was funded by the China Scholarship Council to conduct joint research at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. Before joining Nanjing University, I visited the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 

My research interests include revenue management, queueing games, and supply chain management. I have published multiple academic papers in renowned international journals such as Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, Production and Operations Management, Naval Research Logistics, and International Transactions in Operational Research. 

I have led one project supported by the Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China and one project supported by the Youth Project of the Humanities and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China, and have participated in several General Projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. 

I received the 2023 M&SOM Best Paper Nomination Award, the Third Prize of the Best Paper Award at the Fourth National Conference on Supply Chain and Operations Management, and the Outstanding Paper Award for Young Faculty at the 15th International Workshop on Behavioral Operations Management.
